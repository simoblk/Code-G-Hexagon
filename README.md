# Code-G-Hexagon
This Python script generates G-code for a hexagon-shaped toolpath based on user inputs for SW (a width parameter) and an optional Z line command. The G-code is designed for CNC machines and includes commands for tool movement, compensation, and positioning to create a hexagonal pattern.
